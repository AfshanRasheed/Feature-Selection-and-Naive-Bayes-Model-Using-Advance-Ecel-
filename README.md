# Feature Selection and Apply Naive Bayes Model
Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of input features that are most relevant to the target variable. 
The two most commonly used feature selection methods for numerical input data when the target variable is categorical (e.g. classification predictive modeling) are the ANOVA f-test statistic and the mutual information statistic.
In this project I am used ANOVA table for feature selection and then apply Naive Bayes Model.

All the work done using excel.
